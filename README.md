## Employee Data Analysis

The motivation of this project is to analyze employee information and how quickly any information of an employee can be found out. Two datasets were made by myself in csv. First dataset contains the demographics of employees and the second is for showing the relationship with the company. Two datasets contain a total 50 columns and 5 rows.

## Approaches Employed

**Data Wrangling:** This is the first step where data inspection is done to ensure NULL values and missing values are detected and data replacement methods are used to replace missing or NULL values.
1. Build a database
2. Create a table and insert the data.
3. Select columns with null values in them. Deleted all NULL values from the datasets, deleted unnecessary rows and Character, renamed column index.

**Feature Engineering:** This will help generate some new columns from existing ones.
Added a new column named “Gender” to give insight of employees gender in the form of Male and Female. This will help answer the question which are based on Gender.
